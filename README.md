# digitalDecay
final project for the tu berlin seminars "Noise : Feedback : Noise" and "Invocations of Space and their Discontents" by Dr. Paula Matthusen.

digitalDecay is a script to process audio in a recursive way that it falls apart and decays. the inspiration of this project comes from William Basinski's "Disintegration Loops". i find it very interesting that analog media evolves with time; an audio piece on vinyl or tape will never sound exactly the same twice. this decay process gets lost in modern media, thats why i tried to integrate a digital decay process with this project.

pieces i made with the script: https://soundcloud.com/lucahilbrich/sets/digital-decay


you can try it out with your own audiofile! just download the whole repository, create a folder in the same directory named 'generated_audio' and change the filepath of the input audio in the jupyter notebook to your source file. you can use your own (audio) modulation signals as well!

thanks to Supreme-Sector for his cool perlin noise implementation for python i used for my project: https://github.com/Supreme-Sector/Python-Perlin-Noise
