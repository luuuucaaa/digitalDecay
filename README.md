# digitalDecay
final project for the tu berlin seminars "Noise : Feedback : Noise" and "Invocation of Space and their Discontents" by Dr. Paula Matthusen.

digitalDecay is a script to process audio in a recursive way that it falls apart and decays. the inspiration of this project comes from William Basinski's "Disintegration Loops". i find it very interesting that analog media never stays the same; an audio piece on vinyl or tape will never sound exactly the same twice. this decay process gets lost in modern media, thats why i tried to integrate a digital decay process with this project.
