# digitalDecay
final project for the tu berlin seminars "Noise : Feedback : Noise" and "Invocations of Space and their Discontents" by Dr. Paula Matthusen.

digitalDecay is a script to process audio in a recursive way that it falls apart and decays. the inspiration of this project comes from William Basinski's "Disintegration Loops". i find it very interesting that analog media evolves with time; an audio piece on vinyl or tape will never sound exactly the same twice. this decay process gets lost in modern media, thats why i tried to integrate a digital decay process with this project.

you can try it out with your own audiofile! just change the filepath of the input audio in the jupyter notebook.

a piece i made with the script: https://soundcloud.com/lucahilbrich/digital-decay
